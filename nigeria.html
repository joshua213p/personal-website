</p><p id="a36c814a-e314-48d8-9653-9b6b501ff40a" class="">In Canada, when a teenager needs to get an immunization or a bandaid we usually just go to a school nurse or a family clinic. They’re very easy to reach and use, especially if you live in an urban area. You can almost always trust your doctor or nurse to give you the appropriate treatment you need and give qualified health advice.</p><p id="d52feab7-c480-40c0-9a41-8bbf989afd42" class="">Unfortunately, this is rarely the case for developing countries. In developing countries, the budget, prioritization, and social support around a highly functional healthcare system is often very low.</p><p id="3dc0342f-05cb-4358-ae6d-2d9f678d46a6" class="">A solution that many developing nations are exploring is a health system called primary healthcare (PHC). Basically, building health posts and repurposing houses to deliver basic health services (e.g. immunization or a bandaid) with high patient satisfaction and financial viability.

There’s also no reporting system for the success of a referral if a referral actually goes through. Communication between levels of care in the referral process is extremely weak; zero follow-up or feedback from the receiving facility or patient is the norm.</p><p id="75dd4600-695b-44e9-9703-9fe82aa3d070" class=""><strong>Corruption within the health system</strong></p><p id="4563828b-e0c4-41e4-921a-2119bbfc949d" class="">In a report by Gavi, it was found that $2.2M USD had been misused within the health sector by Nigerian officials… and refunded to them. The issue of corruption is wide ranging with tons of different actors, like senior/junior admin officers in health ministries, health personnel and agencies.</p><p id="36f4e6e5-bcd0-4968-9eff-543a44ef508e" class="">Interestingly, corruption can be directly linked to quality of healthcare provided → it’s been estimated that a 10% increase in corruption = 10–20% reduce in immunization rates.</p><p id="160b86eb-e54e-49a0-88e0-98037215dd16" class="">The primary causes for why this still exists (despite being a priority for political leadership) is a lack of transparency and adherence to law within the health sector, and how the public sector is ruled by ineffective civil service codes with weak accountability mechanisms.</p><p id="305ec537-d9db-4875-82e7-33743722c48a" class=""><strong>Lack of clarity around responsibility of local governments for PHC</strong></p><p id="d3684a84-1f86-4c97-ae3d-aad0df94d506" class="">Local governments are expected to be the main implementers of PHC policies and programs, but the constitution makes it unclear whether states are expected to be more responsible for PHC delivery. Sometimes, this leads to confusion in roles and responsibilities of those governing PHC, and weaker management = weaker quality of care.</p><p id="f1095c1a-9320-4d15-9349-0b0c6cc89299" class="">It’s pretty clear that there are a ton of problems and respective causes for why PHC facilities aren’t meeting expectations for quality of care. From the citizen perspective, barriers of accessibility are also deterrents from utilizing primary healthcare services.</p><h2 id="aa897bf0-4a2e-4d91-89e2-6703941f529c" class=""><strong>Problems with Nigerian PHC Access</strong></h2><p id="4a608a3d-2d0c-4a8c-9c32-6f3ef2b44baa" class="">Women have enormous influence over their communities and their usage of health services. If the women see a PHC facility as excellent and love its services, the community as a whole will use the PHC facility. Additionally, these health centres concentrate most on providing maternal and child care services (which, culturally, women take almost complete responsibility of).</p><p id="0d50883d-1db8-43d7-8d45-99604a59b346" class="">Therefore, when understanding why residents of a community don’t attend a PHC facility, it’s important to specifically focus on why women don’t → everything depends on <em>their</em> reasons and experiences. Women in rural areas face the most problems with accessibility and motivation to use PHC, and here’s why:</p><p id="a8be2394-4ac2-4142-a058-e8e75499b8ec" class=""><strong>Physical Accessibility Factors</strong></p><p id="237e3796-395b-43b1-bfbf-07a0f65f0da1" class="">PHC centers are far and hard to get to for pregnancy care, especially if you don’t own a motorcycle (the majority of people in rural communities). Very unappealing.</p><p id="c6fb182f-e275-4ef5-b65e-dedb7cbce49a" class="">The major constraint on transportation is poor roads. Especially when PHC facilities are outside of short walking distance, poor road networks (hard to navigate, non-motorable) prevent rural Nigerians are a massive obstacle. In the event of heavy rainfall or undeveloped road infrastructure, people are trapped inside their communities and are forced to default to traditional birth attendants (TBAs, people who assist with births without formal training) or elders for pregnancy delivery.</p><figure id="2f4fd67f-b69d-4339-a3bd-60ef9c5560d3" class="image"><a href="Gaps%20in%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20Flawed%20Model%20for%20Universal%20Healt%201f383bef726b40f789f63e5088a35f99/Untitled%2012.png"><img style="width:495px" src="Gaps%20in%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20Flawed%20Model%20for%20Universal%20Healt%201f383bef726b40f789f63e5088a35f99/Untitled%2012.png"/></a><figcaption>Very difficult to travel on without a car, which most don’t have | <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmnewsnigeria.com%2F2018%2F12%2F06%2Fbad-roads-in-our-communities-cause-accidents-abuja-motorists-cry-out%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3I2ZXdlp1ozK5tAOCKqJAQ&amp;ust=1612299409241000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCOjdsr_Jye4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a837d1fb-f5cd-4f09-9549-399192040ad7" class="">
</p><p id="525290a3-1c96-4378-a952-5221e130983c" class="">In fact, roads can be so bad that they can cause miscarriages when trying to transport pregnant women to PHC facilities. Not a risk I think many would want to take.</p><p id="c5ce4420-0211-4c1a-a2b8-e8e5a57f2488" class="">Even if road networks aren’t particularly horrible, if you don’t have a motorcycle (the most common vehicle), having to walk long distances for health services is extremely demotivating — especially in cases of emergency. Lots of communities don’t have a PHC facility nearby (despite a strong want), and so giving birth at home is considered the next best option.</p><p id="74996bbf-425a-4162-af77-a3fee34d50b9" class="">Facilities also aren’t always open, and citizens are often uncertain as to whether a health worker is present and available to care for clients. Hours of operation are usually <em>just</em> <em>10am-2pm</em>. Adding to this, nurses are known to abandon centers to go to the market or other places.</p><p id="77e601e6-97a9-49c8-9229-eb472bc2b06d" class="">If you had to travel long distances over poor roads without a car, without even knowing if the center is open, just for a chance at low-quality health services… you probably wouldn’t feel all that encouraged to use PHC either.</p><p id="bd73e304-09e0-4446-a18c-1d35d5afb252" class=""><strong>Perceptions of Poor Quality of Care @ PHC</strong></p><p id="1d85daba-3f37-4562-9bae-2c949317ba58" class="">Women in rural areas would rather give birth at home than at a PHC center. They see very little value from the services provided by facilities. This is largely because of how HRH behave (remembering how they’re demotivated to work in rural communities and have low accountability/transparency mechanisms).</p><p id="9f4bfb08-a448-4e77-b6c8-884e13478337" class="">Provider competence is generally perceived to be poor → citizens, especially women, aren’t confident in the people working at PHC facilities. Some workers can’t even recognize signs of labor in women, and waiting times are extremely high (often with no good reason). As such, it’s a custom to not go to PHC centers and instead visit TBAs or elders, who are thought of as more experienced and helpful.</p><p id="984940da-bf2f-4b39-9333-9b6511600492" class="">Health workers are also known to be unfriendly and deceptive. As you probably know, pregnant women are super emotional and moody during labor. They’ve said that nurses can make them feel <em>worse →</em> by shouting at them, not giving them proper care, and generally not being nice people. Sometimes they’re even borderline scammy, adding in informal charges to patients, suggesting inappropriate referrals to make them pay more, and completely not caring for patients. In some areas, nurses are known to pressure patients into purchasing drugs they need to buy at ridiculous margins.</p><p id="a0573708-edc8-4f06-b74c-3ebb2822d13b" class="">It gets worse. The amount of providers at centers usually isn’t enough, and for those who are there, unavailability to serve clients is painfully common. It’s hard to find a real doctor at a facility, who patients view as a necessity for high quality of care. Nurses are usually present, but sometimes, aren’t around on weekends or only are present in late hours. The issue of inadequate staffing is perceived as one of the biggest detractors from using PHC.</p><p id="03726497-ba95-484f-82d8-094912021a60" class=""><strong>Cost of Care</strong></p><p id="b1b7ec42-3267-466b-a917-7f249bb80baf" class="">The direct cost of care of using PHC services is another barrier. The price is seen as high for a government hospital — people would rather pay less for a private hospital, even if that means paying more for transport.</p><p id="2c540ebb-d489-48ee-9a5e-0a5be4bd16c7" class=""><strong>example direct costs of care at different facilities:</strong></p><ul id="c6ae49c5-e787-4f06-9637-1bde515ebfbd" class="bulleted-list"><li>₦10,000 (US$27.8), ₦12000 (US$33.3), ₦8000 (US$22.2)</li></ul><blockquote id="80569807-5f84-4600-b848-755027510e36" class="">“Why our women are not using this PHC centre is because the price is high and it is a government hospital, when our women give birth here, they are charged Naira10,000 (US$27.8), Naira12000 (US$33.3), Naira8000 (US$22.2).

Malpractice is also suspected on behalf of PHC because of how high costs are, and what the government initially should’ve set them to be. However, direct cost of care isn’t seen as the biggest barrier and some think the prices charged are reasonable.</p><p id="a7136f3d-3f82-42af-9c15-78428c1a4590" class="">That being said, TBA pricing is known to be much more flexible and much cheaper. Considering the other downsides of PHC centers, TBAs are seen as the better option. This is because, even if costs of care objectively aren’t that high, rural citizens likely still can’t pay them. Considering 70% of Nigerians live on less than $1 USD daily, it’s difficult to find a price that’s viable for a PHC facility while accomodating all patient needs.</p><p id="7a1d0aa2-6f8b-49fb-b32f-b65453bf3e89" class=""><strong>Husband Support</strong></p><p id="9d04538e-78e9-492d-8073-e96223e8a9c8" class="">In Nigerian culture, husbands support their pregnant wives in various ways. A lack of support can prevent pregnant women from being able to use PHC services. This could be in terms of money, or even assistance in domestic chores like caring for children. Although, sometimes, men give women money to go to PHC clinics → but there’s the possibility that it isn’t enough to match the cost of care.</p><p id="899b94ae-e3a1-46e7-981c-c54acf7814ad" class=""><strong>Misinterpretation of Signs of Pregnancy Complications</strong></p><p id="23f86313-9441-4371-bfdf-81ab60c827ad" class="">Lastly, it’s not impossible that women don’t realize they have pregnancy complications and falsely think they don’t need the help of a PHC to give birth.</p><p id="8c8fadaa-3356-4ea3-a8ea-ca757c3df4ac" class="">All of these factors multiply against one another in dissuading rural women from using PHC for health services over local alternatives, thus causing a community-wide distrust in the PHC system. To tackle this problem and promote the utilization of primary healthcare services, such key barriers with quality and access need to be addressed and solved.</p><figure id="e25976e1-cf18-4332-8d7b-7ad2f82aacb6" class="image"><a href="Gaps%20in%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20Flawed%20Model%20for%20Universal%20Healt%201f383bef726b40f789f63e5088a35f99/Untitled%2013.png"><img style="width:600px" src="Gaps%20in%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20Flawed%20Model%20for%20Universal%20Healt%201f383bef726b40f789f63e5088a35f99/Untitled%2013.png"/></a><figcaption>No one should have to give birth in a facility with a broken roof | <a href="https://punchng.com/inside-some-nigerias-appalling-public-health-centres/">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="320d6f8a-3b64-47cf-be93-fc36b528b9db" class="">There’s no reason why accessing health services as simple as a pill bottle or diapers should be impossible, anywhere.
